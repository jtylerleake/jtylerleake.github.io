I am a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University (M.S. in Computer Science), where I concentrated on topics in artificial intelligence. My research interests 
lie at the intersection of machine learning theory and engineering. I'm particularly interested in the mathematical foundations 
of modern machine learning systems, from the optimization algorithms that train models to the architectures that make them effective. From an engineering 
perspective, I'm keen on building and evaluating model ensembles to understand how different compositions perform in diverse settings. I'm especially drawn 
to these questions within the context of reinforcement learning. 

<br><br>In addition to my computer science studies, I hold a background in finance. Prior to Johns Hopkins, I worked at the FinTech 
software company <a href="https://loan-street.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoanStreet</a> and received my B.S. in Finance from Penn State University.

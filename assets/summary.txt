I am a recent graduate of Johns Hopkins University (M.S. in Computer Science), where I concentrated on topics in artificial intelligence. My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning theory and engineering. I'm particularly interested in the mathematical foundations of modern machine learning systems, from the optimization algorithms that train models to the architectures that make them effective. In addition to my computer science studies, I hold a background in finance. Prior to Johns Hopkins, I worked at the FinTech software company <a href="https://loan-street.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoanStreet</a> and received my B.S. in Finance from Penn State University.

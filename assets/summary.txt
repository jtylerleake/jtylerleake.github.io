I'm a recent computer science graduate from Johns Hopkins (M.S. Computer Science), where I earned my master's with a concentration in AI/ML. My core interests lie in machine learning theory and engineering practice. In particular, I'm interested in Reinforcement Learning as both an area of theoretical challenge and as a framework for solving problems. A central focus here (and generally in ML) is the mathematical mechanics of learning algorithms, examining properties such as optimization behavior, computational efficiency, sclaing, and convergence guarantees. Ultimately, I'm passionate about the design and engineering required to translate theoretical insights into effective technologies. 

<br><br> In addition to my computer science studies, I hold a background in finance. Prior to Johns Hopkins, I worked at the FinTech software startup <a href="https://loan-street.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LoanStreet</a> and received my B.S. in Finance from Penn State University.
